📊 Data Science with Python – School Assignments & CAT Tasks
📌 Introduction

This repository contains all my school assignments and CAT (Continuous Assessment Test) tasks related to Data Science and Python programming. It is designed as a learning hub where I apply theoretical concepts to practical problems using Python and its data science ecosystem.

🧠 What is Data Science?

Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that uses statistics, mathematics, and computer science to extract meaningful insights from data. It involves:

Data Collection – gathering raw information from different sources (e.g., CSV files, databases, APIs, web scraping).

Data Cleaning – preprocessing and handling missing, duplicate, or noisy data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – using visualization and statistics to understand patterns.

Model Building – applying machine learning techniques to predict or classify outcomes.

Communication – presenting findings clearly through reports, visualizations, and dashboards.

🐍 Why Python for Data Science?

Python is the most popular programming language for data science because it is:

Simple & Readable – great for beginners and professionals alike.

Rich Ecosystem – libraries such as:

numpy → numerical computing

pandas → data manipulation

matplotlib & seaborn → visualization

scikit-learn → machine learning

Open-source & Community-driven – widely supported with tons of resources.
